# Javascript => Html Conversion


 ## `return React.createElement("h1",null,"Hello React",`

 ## &nbsp; &nbsp; `React.createElement("span",null,"Fastest App"))`
# VS

## ```<h1>Hello React</h1> ```
## ```<span>Fastest App</span> ```



# JSX Doesn't have class Property.

# JSX has CamelCase support.(example-tabIndex)
## Except ```data-custom``` and ```aria-label```.(example-animalType)

# JSX doesn't support "for" from html attributes.
